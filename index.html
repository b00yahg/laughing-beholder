          Welcome to The Laughing Beholder, where your host Large Luigi brings enlightenment and entertainment to the Rock of Bral. Once a seeker of cosmic wisdom from H'Catha, Luigi completed the legendary thousand-mile climb of the Spire, gaining extraordinary knowledge and understanding. Unlike his kin, he believes in sharing wisdom rather than hoarding it, making his tavern a unique haven for both locals and space-farers alike.

          Through his detect lie eye-power and natural charm, Luigi ensures both honest dealings and peaceful revelry. Watch in wonder as he serves drinks with telekinetic precision while keeping an eye (or several) on the establishment's good order. All he asks in return for his vast knowledge is a good story or song to entertain his patrons.
